### THE PROBLEM BEING TACKLED
#### Brief

**“We are going to research the transportation methods and habits of the students living around Leicestershire, UK. So that design a sustainable way to optimize their traveling in the 15-minute neighborhood.”**

As students at Loughborough University, we have found that
many students lack a suitable means of transport when traveling
between school and town, or to the library for study.

So to solve this problem, our idea was based on the conception
of an immediate, free public transport option for short distances to
meet the flexible travel needs of the student population

An Affinity Diagram is created sourcing from interview, survey and observation:

### IDEATION AND DEVELOPMENT STEPS
#### BRAINSTORMING

{{< figure src="/images/projects/S-Scooter/4.jpg" width="100%" >}}

- The priority matrix method is used to reorder the ideas from the brainstorming refers to the coordinate.
- Ideas that are allocated in the “Sweet spot” could be developed forward in the next step

#### MAIN FEATURES
##### SHARE

unlock them with Lboro Student Card, and start
their trips in Lboros**

- Setting Drop-Off Points as Charging Stations for Electric Scooters
- Easily storage hooks and safety equipment provided (helmet)
- Showing the CO2 consumption or carbon footprint/money saving for using sharing e-scooter.

##### SAFE
**We are committed to the safety of students when
students use this product and travel on campus.**

- Automatic speed reduction in certain areas such as pedestrian zones or crowded areas.
- Night mode make sure students safety on road
- Setting Speed Limit on Scooters when riding in campus
- Sharing location with friends, always have accompany on road


##### SWIFT
**A swift way of transport for short trips around campus. E-scooters are lighter and quicker.**

- Give a more accurate travel time at the time of departure
- The e-scooter system helps students to reach campus facilities in every corner of the Loughborough campus.

### HERO SHOT
“We believe, there is an opportunity to design an **e-scooter sharing system** for the **student and
staff living around the Loughborough campus** that **cultivates a more sustainable transport
method** so that they experience a **sustainable and efficient transport style**.”

### STORYBOARD
{{< figure src="/images/projects/S-Scooter/6.jpg" width="100%" >}}

### DESIGN DETAIL
#### Existing Problems
1. Illegal
   - E-scooters are illegal on the
roads and footpaths and
banned from campus in
general
2. Dangerous
   - Users not wearing helmets and lack other protective measures
   - Users keep high speed in congested ways
3. Unconvenient
   - Finding scooters and paying for them is complicated
   - It's easy to get lost when you can't use your phone while using a scooter

#### Our Service
1. Legal
    - **Cycle Optimised Protected Signals** (CYCLOPS) are used to perfect the
problem of electric skateboard travel. This also applies at the **Lboro campus**, where we will be working with the **local Council** to develop our
own mobility system for e-scooters.
2. Safety
   - Users are reminded to **wear protective tools** before unlocking
   - S-Scooter assesses **safety credit** for the user and offers driving
incentives accordingly
   - S-Scooter **slows down automatically** for users in heavy traffic
1. Convenient
   - S-Scooter can be integrated with the **My Lobro scheduling and payment system**, enabling automatic appointment recommendations and student
card swiping for scooter unlocking, thereby enhancing user
convenience.
   - S-Scooter offers **AR / Voice navigation**



### NEXT STEPS
#### Our Business Proposition
As a start-up company, we need to conduct small-
scale operational testing. To achieve rapid product
iteration as well as brand promotion.

Electric Scooters
- Invest in quality scooters that are reliable and safe for the
customers.

Licenses and Permits

### CHALLENGE TO TAKE FORWARDS LONG-TERM
#### How to ensure that users are safe when using our services
- From the bike structure, add sensors to the vehicle to provide accurate safety alerts and helmet storage improvements.
- Work further with schools to combine and demarcate lanes so that e-scooters and bicycles have their own roads.
- If possible we would like to work with the Leicestershire authorities to promote e-scooters and improve tram regulations.

#### How we can improve our services to make them more user-friendly
- Optimise vehicle scheduling in parking areas to meet the needs of most users in different areas.
- Adding navigation information to the dashboard of the electric scooter for the convenience of the user and making it possible to connect it to a mobile phone.

#### How to keep our services running in the long term
- Optimising the booking mechanism for the use of vehicles so that they can be fully utilised.
- Add incentives for energy-saving behaviour, such as coupons, to encourage users to reduce car use and use electric vehicles more often over short distances
