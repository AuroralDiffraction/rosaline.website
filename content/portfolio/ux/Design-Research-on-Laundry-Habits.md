### Hunt Statement
####  Background and initial Hunt statement
In this research, we focus on the process of washing clothes and study the
impact of clothes washing on the environment. A scoping tool: The 5Ws and
1H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How) is used to investigate a certain
brief or context.

{{< figure src="/images/projects/Design-Research-Methods/1.jpg" width="50%"  >}}

Pet owners were intrigued and decided to study. I myself am a pet owner,
and there are many pet owners across the world. Pets tend to change fur or
make a mess, which results in extra laundry to be done. I am interested in
finding out how keeping pets affect the laundry habits of people, and how this
impacts the environment.

Therefore, I chose:
**“I am going to research the washing behaviour and practices of the students who keep pets so that I can optimize the laundry washing process for pet owners.”.**

#### Pilot study: Auto-ethnography
Before setting off the investigative research, a pilot filming was conducted to
explore the process of doing laundry for people and pets.

For convenience, an observation has been done to see the process of doing
laundry for people and pets at my home in Wuhan China. Their ex periences
were documented with photos and video, and notes were made on the
reflections of this experience. It indicates that keeping pets may increase the
amount of laundry that needs to be done, so the impact of pet ownership on
people’s laundry behavior needs to be explored.

Auto-ethnography is a method of conducting qualitative research that
focuses on participant observation or the ethnographic method, in which
the researcher is embedded in settings to write about social groups that are
different from their own. (Besio, 2009)

Therefore it was used as the first research to have a basic understanding
of doing laundry for owners and pets, to come up with a guide for the later
interviews and observations.

{{< figure src="/images/projects/Design-Research-Methods/2.jpg" width="40%"  >}}

##### Data Collection
When I was in my hometown of Wuhan, China, I used to do laundry for myself and
my pet.

I used video and photography to record my experience and the laundry process, and
I also wrote notes about my observations afterward.

From the pilot study, the steps in a basic laundry process were observed. From these
steps, a basic structure for the interview can be established. Following the basic laundry
process, the process of doing pet’s laundry was also observed. A couple of differences
were spotted when comparing doing the person’s own laundry and doing the pet’s
laundry. The differences are labeled in bold in Figure 2.

The following are the points of interest found from this pilot study:
- What are the differences between doing own laundry and doing the laundry of pets?
- Why is there a difference? What are the reasons behind the different steps taken?
- Does having a pet affect laundry decisions and processes?
- Do laundry habits change after keeping a pet?
  
The findings and points of interest from the pilot study are then used to write
an interview guide in preparation for the semi-structured interview and the later
observations.

##### Reflection
Since I had a pet in my hometown, I chose auto ethnography and reenact methods. From
observations,
- I gained first impression on the laundry process concerning pet’s, and was
able to write a guide for the interview, which is a good start for the research.

The disadvantage of this study is that:
- Since I didn’t have a pet in the UK, it was hard to complete auto
ethnography. I had to record my habits with notes, and ask my family at home
to re-enact what I did and made the raudio-visual recording. This limits the
observations as it will not be as detailed.

### Methodology

#### Collecting data: Interviews: Semi-structured interview
##### Introduction
A method of the contextual semi-structured interview has been chosen to
take both the advantages of structured interviews and unstructured interviews.
On the one hand, Semi-structured interviews are more flexible and adaptive
than structured interviews, which can give a better experience to participants.
Semi-structured make the Q&A more like an ordinary conversation and allow
participants to provide a lot of information more freely. On the other hand, the
overview of a semi-structured interview can help the interviewer manage the
structure of the interview and control time.

##### Data Collection
Based on the auto-ethnography and the question part that the research
focuses on, an overview has been written to manage the contextual semi-
structured interview.

This interview guide includes the problems found and the aspects I wanted
to know while doing the pilot study. The guide is used to plan the structure
and to control the direction of the interview. Three participants, all pet keepers
and PhD students in Loughborough University, are selected to participate in
my research. A semi-structured interview is held with each participant based
on the interview guide. After the participants answered the questions, in-
depth questions based on their responses were asked to explore the reasons
behind their behaviour. After completing the interviews, their responses were
transcribed (which are shown in the appendix) and analysed.

{{< figure src="/images/projects/Design-Research-Methods/4.jpg" width="100%"  >}}
{{< figure src="/images/projects/Design-Research-Methods/5.jpg" width="100%"  >}}

Based on the pilot study, an interview guide is written. It acts as an overview
to the semi-structured interview, and controls how the interview is conducted.

The interview guide consists of a set of 33 questions, split into 5 groups:
- Basic information
- About pets
- About own laundry
- About pet’s laundry
- About laundry habits
  
The guide aims to obtain detailed information about their thoughts and
behaviour of their laundry practices as a pet owner. It is structured such that
basic information about their pets and themselves are first obtained, then
basic details of they do their own laundry, after that details of how they do
the laundry of their pets, and last of all, details on their laundry habits and
thoughts

##### Reflection

**Benefits**
- Generally quick to conduct.
- provides good access to the user’s character, goals, and emotional responses.
- The researcher can guide the conversation and redirect it as needed.
- Deep levels of knowledge and understanding are possible.
- Users can display or respond to interview-related objects or props.

**Limitations**
- Setting up is a lengthy process.
- Poor questions may lead to and influence user responses, and the interviewer’s or researcher’s personality may have an impact on the results.
- extreme attention paid to what the user says rather than what they do.
- It is challenging to compare interviews because no two interviews are same.
- It takes a lot of time and effort to analyse (Hall. E, 2013)

**Reflection of experience**

In the semi-structured interview, I selected three participants and went to
their houses for an in-depth interview. Finding students that have pets and
are willing to be a participant proved to be much harder than I thought. The
interview itself was smooth and fun. The most interesting part is that you are
able to observe the differences in how people do simple things. Overall I think
the interview was quite nicely done and I obtained the data that I needed.

#### Design Ethnography: Shadowing

##### Introduction
Typically, the exploratory and evaluation phases of research projects utilise
design ethnography.

Observation implies paying close attention to and meticulously document-
ing phenomena, such as people, artefacts, surroundings, events, behaviours,
and interaction.(Martin et al., 2012)

Shadowing is conducted to perform design ethnography. It’s a method that’s
frequently used in user research. The concept is straightforward: while the user
is being observed, the researcher watches how they use the good or service in
their environment. (The Interaction Design Foundation, 2020)

To do laundry for pets and oneself, a deeper understanding of the behavior
of individual candidates is required. Shadowing is a method to perform in-
depth observation of the behaviors and emotions of the participants and record
their laundry process. Compared to participant observation, it will not interfere
and interrupt the participant’s behavior and thoughts. A short interview after
the shadowing was performed to alleviate its limitations.

##### Data Collection

According to the content of the interview, the three participants all do
their own laundry and pets’ laundry separately. Therefore, shadowing is
used to observe them do their own laundry and pets’ laundry separately.
Videos were recorded, then summarized and analyzed using AEIOU, which is
included in the data analysis and appendix sections.

##### Ethics

Following ethics is a crucial throughout the research. This study was
conducted under ethical regulations of Loughborough University. The data
collected in the research will only be used for this study, will be anonymized
and securely stored. All three participants are fully aware of how the collected
data is used, have read the participant information sheet, and signed a written
consent form.

##### User Journey Map

{{< figure src="/images/projects/Design-Research-Methods/8.jpg" width="100%"  >}}

#####  Reflection
**Benefits**

- Straightforward
- Does not interfere with participant behavior and emotions
- Little or no investment

**Limitations**

- Easy to substitute for the investigator’s bias
- Low observation efficiency
- Inability to instantly understand the particular behaviour of participants

**Reflection of experience**

Shadowing is the most fun part of the observation. I followed the
participants when they were doing laundry, and used a gopro to record their
behavior. I was able to obtain video data, which could be observed and then
analysed.

It was even harder to arrange for the shadowing, as PhD students are very
busy, and I also had to wait for the participants to do laundry. Moreover, all
participants said that they do laundry for themselves and pets separately, so
not only do I have to wait for them to wash their own clothes, but I also have
to wait for them to do laundry for pets. The two processes are hard to piece
together, so I spend a lot of time doing the observation.

One drawback is that pointing a camera at the participant makes them
nervous, which might affect their behavior, although I use shadowing to reduce
my presence as much as possible to lessen their distraction.

### Data Analysis
#### Analysing Video Data: AEIOU
AEIOU templates are used to organize data collected from the laundry
process of their own clothes and their pet’s clothes. The three participants
each have a set of AEIOU forms that record their data. Simple analysis is also
performed in the AEIOU. The AEIOU forms can be found in the next page.

##### Reflection
**Benefits**

- Enables the meaningful systematic cataloguing and analysis of visual data.
- Maps out several facets of the user’s behaviour and surroundings visually.
- Discovers hidden behaviours, workarounds, and needs.

**Limitations**

- Does not allow for the capture of broader social, political, or cultural factors.
- Excludes other stakeholders in favour of partcipants.

**Reflection of experience**

I used the AEIOU template to categorize and sort all the data I had from
the observations. I think they are pretty straightforward to use and really help
me sort up the pile of data into more manageable points. However, as a static
template, AEIOU can be limited when logging dynamic data from videos as a
lot of small details are discarded or not logged in the AEIOU forms.

#### Affinity Mapping
Affinity diagrams cluster observations and insights in a meaningful way to
keep design teams aware of data when they are designing. (Martin et al., 2012)

{{< figure src="/images/projects/Design-Research-Methods/12.jpg" width="100%"  >}}

### Finding
#### What I saw and heard

{{< figure src="/images/projects/Design-Research-Methods/14.jpg" width="100%"  >}}

### Insights
#### Introduction
Insights are intuitive understandings of user behavior based on user research
that can inspire creative design ideas. (Kumar V., 2012) Insights come from
findings and observations. They are intuitive and depend on the researcher’s
thoughts, creativity and vision. Insights vary from person to person, but they
all provide creativity that can be turned into opportunities.

From the patterns in the affinity diagram and the findings, insights can be
drawn. Then we use a 2x2 evaluation matrix to select 3-5 key insights.

The key insights will then be used to derive opportunities.

#### Key Insights
##### Keeping pets lead to increased detergent and sanitizer use
- What we saw/ heard

{{< figure src="/images/projects/Design-Research-Methods/15.jpg" width="50%"  >}}

- What it means

Participants tend to use more detergent and/or sanitizer when they are doing
their pet’s laundry, potentially having to wash/rinse a second time. Especially
for laundry beads, participants can only add another bead, potentially adding
too much detergent.

- Why it matters

Doing a second wash/rinse will increases water and energy use, potentially
having a bad effect on the environment.

##### Cleanliness determines whether pet’s laundry can be washed together with own laundry.
- What we saw/ heard

{{< figure src="/images/projects/Design-Research-Methods/16.jpg" width="40%"  >}}

- What it means
  
Laundry are mostly separated by cleanliness, no matter if it is from own
laundry or from pet’s. Most of the time the participant’s own laundry is
separated from their pet’s laundry because their pet’s laundry is much dirtier.
But after washing, the two types of laundry are dried together on the same rack
or in the same dryer.

- Why it matters

Seperating laundry leads to more laundry cycles, and potentially more
energy consumption. If pet’s laundry and own laundry can be mixed together,
there will be no need to do two laundries, therefore cutting water electricity use
in half.


##### Participants do laundry because of their own psychological feelings
- What we saw/ heard

{{< figure src="/images/projects/Design-Research-Methods/17.jpg" width="40%"  >}}

- What it means

Psychological factors of the participants are also a crucial factor when
deciding whether or not to wash something. All three participants said they
would wash their clothes when they feel that their clothes are dirty.

- Why it matters

This was the case for all three interviewers, who usually washed their clothes
because they felt they needed to be washed. This may increase the time of
laundry and add additional energy consumption.

##### Time spent was one of the important factors influencing participants’ choice of laundry method
- What we saw/ heard

{{< figure src="/images/projects/Design-Research-Methods/18.jpg" width="40%"  >}}

- What it means

Straightforward

Does not interfere with participant behavior and emotions

Little or no investment


- Why it matters

As a group of PhD students, they have a strong sense of time and will care
about the time spent. Therefore, it is more acceptable to study how to save
energy while saving time.

### Opportunities: HMW
“How Might We” Questions, or HMW in short, is a series of small
questions that stimulate brainstorming. (“ How Might We” Questions, n.d.)
The researchers ask themselves these questions to help boost creativity and
thoughts. HMW questions usually are derived from insights, and lead to
potential opportunities.

{{< figure src="/images/projects/Design-Research-Methods/20.jpg" width="100%"  >}}

### Reflections
#### Reflection on methodology and process
In this design research, I selected three PhD students that keep pets to
research on their laundry behavior. I conducted a pilot study, followed by three
semi-structured interviews, three shadowing observations, and a couple of
follow up interview questions. I am happy with how these methods performed,
and I was able to obtain a lot of data. The data was then sorted and analyzed
using AEIOU and affinity diagrams. Then I came up with insights and
performed reflection.

During the research, I was able to
- Obtain first-hand information from listening to and observing the participants
- Ask in-depth questions based on their answers, gaining more knowledge.
- Analyse their data and extract findings and insight
  
I find the hardest part of the research is to come up with the insights and
HMW. Coming up with insights and actions require lots of observation and
critical thinking, drawing conclusions from the observation data and analysis.
It is hard even for simple processes such as doing the laundry. The interview
and the shadowing were the more interesting parts of the research.

As for what could be improved, it would be better if I had more time to
observe more participants. In the three participants, there were two males and
a female, and there were two Chinese and a British person. The gender and
the different cultural backgrounds of the participants might be factors that
influence their behavior, but since the number of participants was too small,
there is not enough evidence to draw a conclusion.

There are also some other things that could be improved:
- Not enough experience in interviewing. I took care not to ask Yes-No questions, but I still ended up asking some.
- Staying unbiased was difficult. I wasn’t sure if I am unbiased enough.
  
#### Reflection as a design researcher

Previously as a product design bachelor student in China, I did not know
how to conduct a proper design research. What I did most were simple
questionairres or online surveys, which only gave limited data and was not
sufficient to fully uncover the details of the behavior of participants. Therefore I
was unable to correctly grasp the pain points in a topic back then.

This has been my first detailed design research that emphasizes on
methodology and logic. Although it was quite challenging, I learned a lot
through the process and enjoyed doing it. I have learnt that a proper research
requires scientific methods, careful and detailed observations, lots of hard work
going through and analyzing data, and lots of thinking to conclude the insights
and reflections.

I drew a skills matrix at the start of the project, and I completed another
one at the end of the project. I found out that through the interviews and
communicating with the participants, I am now a better listener and observer,
learning to pay closer attention to details. My analytical skills and problem
solving skills have also improved as I am more used to conducting critical
thinking.

Doing design research is an important starting point in a design process, and
I will definitely be using the methodologies that I have learned in this research
for future research studies.
