### Energy Saving APP for GenGame
ONEARTH is an smartphone app in partnership with GenGame energy. Based on a user-centered design approach, ONEARTH targets new parents who are short of money and time and encourages them to use smart meters to ensure the best living conditions for their family, allowing their baby to get the best start in life.
### THE BRIEF
#### WHY CLIMATE CHANGE?
Climate change happens because large amounts of greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere as a result of many human activities worldwide, including, most importantly, burning fossil fuels for electricity generation, heating and transport. Climate change can alter our energy generation potential and energy needs.

#### WHY IT MATTERS?
- The impacts of climate change are increasing in frequency.
- People are at risk of overheating in their homes.
- Extreme temperatures increasee the energy demand for cooling in the summer and heating in winter.

### ROLE OF SMART METERS
#### WHAT ARE SMART METERS?
A new generation of meters installed in homes across Great Britain at no extra cost. Unlike traditional meters, which simply register a running total of energy used, smart gas and electricity meters can record half-hourly price and consumption data and provide automatic meter readings to your energy supplier.

#### WHY ARE THEY IMPORTANT?
- They help users manage their energy costs.
- Could help reduce the user's carbon footprint.
- They can make switching energy suppliers easy.
- Easy to understand.
- Encourages better energy habits.

### TARGET USER
**New Parents**

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
**How might we design a mobile app that utilises smart meter data to encourage time and money-poor new parents to reduce their domestic energy consumption and engage positively with climate action?**

### UNPACK ASSUMPTIONS
{{< figure src="/images/projects/Onearth/3.jpg" width="100%"  >}}

### SECONDARY RESEARCH
#### RESULTS
- Sometimes they are frazzled because they have little experience taking care of children
- Their finances are unstable, yet they have so much expenditure because it takes a lot of money to raise children
- Even families that are struggling will still try to give their children the best things because of their love and affection for their child

#### WHAT IT MEANS?
- The app should not take up too much time, take up too much time and should provide straightforward guidance.
- One of the key motivations for behaviour change is saving more money.
- One of the key motivations of behaviour change is doing something good for their child.

### ROLE OF AI AND PREDICTIVE MODEL
There are three implementations of AI in our application and they are as follows:
- Smart Appliances
- Smart Suggestions
- Predictive Models

### USER OUTCOMES

### BUSINESS OUTCOMES
{{< figure src="/images/projects/Onearth/23.jpg" width="100%"  >}}

### REFLECTIONS
#### ASSUMPTIONS
- What if the banks refused collaboration or found a reason not to help with these services?
- We are assuming they decided to invest in smart appliances.
- How effective will the predictive model be in helping change behaviour?

#### HOW TO TEST
- More secondary research on bank collaborations. Interview bank representatives.
- Use smart meter data to provide recommendations alternatively. Track how many devices get connected to the app.
- User responses to the features can be captured. Further user testing is required.

#### LOOKING FURTHER
- Testing the AI prediction model and its personality to accommodate the users' behaviour.
- Testing the effectiveness of the voice-enabled smart assistant.
- Based on the app usage we can explore more features that can cater to their needs and enhance their experience.
