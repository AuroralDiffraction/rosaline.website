Bus travel is efficient and sustainable yet restricts travellers to long fixed routes. Issues including difficulty locating bus stops, feelings of insecurity while waiting, and boredom contribute to tourists opting for unsustainable single-occupancy options like Uber. 

However, according to the data from Transport & Environment, PHV drivers in England (including Uber drivers) produced over 81% of the total amount of CO2 in the UK. 

We aimed to create an innovative bus travel experience using VR and AR to improve enjoyment, flexibility, and convenience. Our VR scenario demonstrates the bus travel’s advantages and positive environmental impact. Our AR guides passengers to virtual bus stops, encouraging bus travel selection. User testing applied physical storms, SUS Testing, and USE scoreboards to verify user interest and behavioural change.

To promote bus travel to tourists in Europe’s most visited cities, we need only upload new videos and geo-location information to scale the concept fast.

**UN Goal background** 

The goal for this project is UN Goal No.11 

**SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND COMMUNITIES** 

**The goal target is:**

> By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport.

{{< figure src="/images/projects/DRT-Bus-Experience-Design-for-Tourists/2.png" width="40%"  >}}

To achieve these goals, we decided to improve the bus ride experience by designing with buses in public transport. We wanted to provide a more convenient ride for passengers, and we found that tourists, as a group unfamiliar with the local environment, prefer to travel by taxi. We envisaged using advanced technology to make it easier for tourists to find public transport when they arrive in a city, shorter waiting times, more fun to ride the bus, they can use their mobile phones to learn about the history of a city on the bus, take photos and have a travel experience, and we also wanted to promote the idea of tourists using public transport to reduce traffic and environmental pollution, so we increased their awareness of taking the bus before they arrive in the city during their journey. to make them aware of the environmental benefits of using public transport.

**“How might we design a public transportation experience that utilises advanced technology to encourage more people to travel by public transportation?”**

### Research
#### Research Method

#### Pilot Study 
_This part is done by my team member._
##### Discovering Opportunities
{{< figure src="/images/projects/DRT-Bus-Experience-Design-for-Tourists/5.jpg" width="60%"  >}}

<!-- Before The Journey
- Bus stop is hard to find and usually cost a long time to get there

During The Journey
- It’s boring but if you play you phone online you would probably miss your stop

After The Journey
- Sometimes causes delay because it don’t arrive on time

App Using Experience
- Hard to find the departure time and routine

**Affinity Diagrams are used to summarize the findings in the pilot study.**

**User Focus Group**
- Sample size: 4
- Research location: Nottingham
- Participants: People (who often use cars)
  
**Insights**
1. Bus views: overcrowded, slow, feels like it takes forever with all the stopping, cannot guarantee a seat, rough areas, hassle, the slowest method 
2. Car views: point-to-point, convenient, safe in rough areas, much easier to transport shopping
3. “Public transport is not often enough going where you need it to go”
4. “Public transport is not as convenient as it should be to appeal to people”
5. “Have to wait in rough areas at night as a woman”
6. “When you get on a bus now, you have no idea how much it will cost” -->

#### As-is Scenario
{{< figure src="/images/projects/DRT-Bus-Experience-Design-for-Tourists/6.jpg" width="100%"  >}}

Build a **better understanding** of tourists’ current experience.

#### Refined Problem Statement
**“How might we design a public transportation experience utilising advanced technology that encourages tourists to change from choosing a taxi to a bus?”**

#### Online Survey
{{< figure src="/images/projects/DRT-Bus-Experience-Design-for-Tourists/7.jpg" width="100%"  >}}

{{< figure src="/images/projects/DRT-Bus-Experience-Design-for-Tourists/8.jpg" width="100%"  >}}

#### Findings and Insights
- Some people still choose public transport because of the price, but it does have the disadvantage of being inconvenient.
- People are not particularly concerned about time costs when travelling and it is acceptable to travel a little slowly or even overstay.
- Most people will play on their mobile phones or listen to music to pass the time on the way, which is partly to blame for the risk of overstaying.
- Most people don't like traffic jams, they prefer to plan their routes in advance and choose routes with good views, but there are taxi apps that sometimes can't judge traffic conditions.
- Unfamiliarity with the route, fear of getting lost, and having luggage are the main reasons why users choose to take a taxi.
- They won't choose to take the bus for environmental reasons because there's nothing to quantify their environmental actions, and they're not willing to pay for abstract concepts with concrete actions.
- Long walks, luggage and other factors can add to fatigue.

#### Technology Selection

{{< figure src="/images/projects/DRT-Bus-Experience-Design-for-Tourists/17.jpg" width="100%"  >}}

<!-- The advanced technology that can be implemented into this project are AR, VR, AI and DRT. 
-	AR can provide a clear reality guidance by augmenting map instructions into the real world
-	VR can provide immersive experiences which is beneficial to promoting environmental awareness and behavior change
-	DRT can provide convenient travel service and experiences
-	AI can be used to optimize the routes, schedules and vehicle allocation of DRT services based on real-time demand and environmental factors

Some technology were not selected.
-	MR, because it did not suit our target goals
-	AR goggles, because they are bulky and not convenient or accessible to tourists
-	Transparent OLED displays, because transparent displays can only be mounted on the bus windows and it would not work when there are many people looking at different directions. -->

#### Vision Statement

{{< figure src="/images/projects/DRT-Bus-Experience-Design-for-Tourists/18.jpg" width="100%"  >}}

### Designing
<!-- #### Methodology for Co-Design
**Co-design** is an approach that involves collaboration and participation of multiple stakeholders in the design process. In the context of designing a DRT bus experience for tourists, co-design methodology can be an effective way to ensure that the final design meets the needs and expectations of tourists.

2 tourists that are target users participated
- Select their preferred features
- Describe their mood
- Tell their ideas and suggestions
- Take part in experiencing interactive presentations and prototypes -->
