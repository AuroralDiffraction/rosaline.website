### Introduction

This project is a group work with three other students.

The project is conducted in collaboration with **TPXimpact**, a digital transformation company based in the UK, supporting organisations to build a better future for people, places and the planet. 

**Team Members: Xiangyu Xiao (me), Mingjin Yang,  Wen Zhou, Yifan Shi**

Within the group, we generally use the **Scrum Framework** to arrange our project, because Scrum is an agile development methodology, which can double the development efficiency of the team and maximize the role of the team compared to the development method under the waterfall process; It can shorten the development cycle and improve the efficiency of project delivery(Leaders and Sennett, 2022).

**Methods**

{{< figure src="/images/projects/industryProject/51.jpg" width="70%"  >}}


Under Scrum's project management framework and the design framework of the Double Diamond model (Kochanowska and Gagliardi, 2022), we use a combination of methods and tools to harmonize creativity and constraints

### Problem statement

- How might we apply circular economy principles to reduce waste on campus?
- **How might we help reverse species loss by using restorative and regenerative approaches on campus?**
- How might we facilitate more sustainable travel for students and staff to help reduce CO2 emissions?

### Project outline

### Problem statement
**Why it’s important ？**
- Recycling is crucial to the **future health** of our
planet -the world’s natural resources are finite,
and some are in very short supply.
- 75% of waste is generally **recyclable**.So
schools make a huge impact when they
recycle.
- Waste reduction and reuse can save campus’
**money**.
- It promotes ethical citizenship in students- that
even the smallest actions matter and that their
actions as consumers and recyclers can make
a **difference**.
- Recycling can also be a creative area which
has a **huge opportunities**.

### User need statement
**FOR USER:**
As the **Students living on campus dormitories in Loughborough University**

Who **don't realize their inadequate handling of waste**
 
We need a way to help them **learn how to properly reuse and recycle waste from circular economy concern aspect**

So that they can **further develop awareness in reducing waste on campus**

**FOR PLANET:**
- Which is **facing land degradation, soil and water contamination**
- We need a way to **reduce the burden caused by waste**
- So that we can **build a planet-centred campus**

### Three solutions

### UX vision statement (person+planet)
#### FOR USER
We believe, there is an opportunity to
design an experience for **students living in on-campus dormitories** in
Loughborough University

to deal with **waste from circular economy concern aspect**

which helps overcome **unfamiliarity** and
**inconvenience** when recycling or reusing
waste

so that students can learn practical
**knowledge** to reduce and recycle waste
on campus.

#### FOR PLANET
We believe, there is an opportunity to
leverage **sustainable practices** and
encouraging reuse and recycling

to **lighten the planet burden** caused by
student dormitories waste

which helps **reduce the pollution** of the
earth

so that planet can have an **eco-friendly ecosystem** and a greener future

### Feature setting strategies

{{< figure src="/images/projects/industryProject/14.png" width="100%"  >}}

1. External **trigger**
Posters that stick around the bins to
remind students that wastes also can be
reused.
2. Internal **motivation**:
    - Give detailed recycle method suggestions. Repeat the tip that wastes can be reused as a priority.
    - Penalties: Demonstrate the harmful effects of failing to recycle properly and evoke users’ empathy.

**Slogan:**
Don't throw it away, it can give
you more.

##### **Using AR technology to scan and get inspiration about reuse.**
- **Motivation**: Incentives-get reward for
reuse. Prove effective in changing
behaviour. People learn more from
positive feedback - the impact is more
profound. (Larson et al., 2011)
- **Motivation**: Social media effect:
Amplifying effects of social support and
social participation.(Evans et al., 2022)

##### **Form 30 days competition and rank system to encourage user continue the behaviour.**
- **Motivation**: Incentives-get reward
for proporate recycle in campus.
Become the recycle star on campus!
(Larson et al., 2011)
- **Motivation**: Social media effect
inside uni: Amplifying effects of social
support and social participation.(Evans
et al., 2022)

### Main features setting

### Risk assumption
**Low risk but…**
- What if the Supplier refused collaboration or found a reason not to support the reward? (Med)
- What if dormitory refuse to put up posters on the wall? (Very low)

### High-fidelity testing
{{< figure src="/images/projects/industryProject/37.png" width="100%"  >}}

- We invited **five** students living on campus dormitory to test the high-fi prototype.
- High-fidelity prototypes give team members a clear idea of how the product will look and work before it ever
goes live.

### Reflection
**Reflection on project:**
1. 1In our project, we aimed to create a
**user-centered design**. Through testing, we
received positive feedback and users expressed
a desire to continue using the app, aligning with
our goal of **long-term behavioral impact**.
2. Users responded well to the app's incentives for
recycling and reusing, particularly the ability to
**save money** and redeem gifts. This feature
could be further improved in future designs.
3. Our app, designed for **Loughborough University**, targets increasing recycling rates in
halls of residence and reducing waste impact.
Feedback suggests potential for scaling the app
to reach a **wider audience**, particularly among
students.

**Reflection on objective factors:**
- User incentives
- User knowledge and awareness
- User capacity limitations
- Research methods and data analysis
