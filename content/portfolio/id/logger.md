### Contribute to meteorological studies while hiking
**LOGGER** is a **smart water bottle** that has multiple **in-built sensors for environmental measurements**. Hikers are able to **contribute to scientific research** by trekking to remote areas that lack internet connection and weather monitoring. The sensors will collect data while hikers are trekking, and upload the data once it connects to the internet. This allows scientist to collect data first-hand from hikers, data gathered from some of the most unstudied and remote places on Earth.
