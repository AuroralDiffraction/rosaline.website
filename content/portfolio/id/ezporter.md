### Fast deployable floating bridge design for rescue
**EzPorter** is **portable and fast-deployable bridge system** that can be used during foods. It implements diferent **modules** that can be utilited in **diferent combinations** to meet different use cases. It can also function as **road barriers** when not in use.

The idea of EzPorter comes from my own experience in floods. My home town is prone to big food in the summer, and I have experenced being stranded and not able to move due to floods. A foating bridge has the flextility to react and deploy quickly wile preserving its capability to tansport a huge number of people at the same time.EzPorter is product design that implements **a brave concept for a brave solution**. I built a huge sandbox model and made avideo of it to demonstrate the function and use case of EzPorter, and 3D printing was used for making the models of the EzPorter modules.
