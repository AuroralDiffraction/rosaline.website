#### Ferrofluid Loudspeakers
**SPACE CUBE** is a **futuristic loudspeaker** that has **built-in audio visualization**. It features **ferrofluid**, which **dances and changes shape** in rhythm with the music that is being played. The loudspeaker has an **elegant and futuristic design**.

The idea comes from one of my school projects where we discuss and experiment with different materials.
Ferrofluid is a special liquid as it is magnetic,so its
unique magnetic properties can be used to achieve stunning effects in designing a product. Space Cube uses **microcontrollers** and **special circuitry** to
anayze music and control the ferrofuid through **electromagnets**. **The combination of special materials and technology creates this cool and aes-thetically pleasing design.**

### Ferrofluid - Design and Analysis
#### Investigation of ferrofluid sticking to the wall

- The reason for ferrofluid sticking to the wall
  
The main component of ferrofluid is solid iron particles that are less than 10 nanometers in size. It appears to flow like a liquid, but it is still made up of solid particles. Once it is not enveloped by a carrier liquid that isolates it from the container, the solid particles will adhere to the container wall. At this time, the container wall will appear black, just like ink seeping and staining the container wall, which makes the appearance worse. The display of ferrofluid equipment will become blurry and unable to achieve good visual effects.

- Factors affecting ferrofluid sticking to the wall

After more than a year of testing and experimentation, it was initially concluded that four factors affect whether ferrofluid sticks to the wall: the material of the display container, the shape of the inner wall of the display container, the quality of the ferrofluid itself, and the suspension liquid.

#### Experiments on the container material

According to the experimental results, high borosilicate glass, crystal glass, and crystal white material glass have smoother surfaces and higher transmittance, making them suitable as ferrofluid containers. High borosilicate glass is generally sold in glass sheets of a certain thickness, and finished products such as glass cups and culture dishes cannot be customized into sealed containers. Only glass sheets of different shapes can be customized. Crystal white material glass is generally used to make perfume bottles and high-end wine bottles, which require molds for production and cannot be customized. However, there are several suitable perfume bottles on the market that can be used as ferrofluid containers. Crystal glass is used to make crystal trophies and ornaments, and is generally cut and milled into the shape required by the customer by the factory. The composition of crystal glass is similar to that of crystal white material glass, both of which are materials with high smoothness and extremely high transmittance. The selection of ferrofluid containers should mainly be based on crystal white material glass and crystal glass. For low-cost ferrofluid audio devices with low requirements, perfume bottles made of crystal white material glass can be used. If the product design is more high-end, customized crystal glass can be considered. If there is a certain market response and sales volume, molds can be made for crystal white material glass to further reduce costs and improve the effect.

### Collaboration between electromagnets and ferrofluids

#### Accoustic signal processing


{{< figure src="/images/projects/SpaceCube/8.jpg" width="60%"  >}}

The audio signal entering the crossover module is divided into a bass part and a treble part. The bass part enters the signal-voltage conversion module and is converted into a DC voltage analog quantity according to the audio loudness; the treble part is separated into the left and right channels and then converted into a DC voltage simulation The analog quantity drives the electromagnet after the voltage amplification module, so the magnetic fluid can change according to the orientation, rhythm, and melody of the music, forming a visual effect of visual music.

### Conclusion

As a music lover, I enjoy a variety of songs and music, and I have always wondered if we could visualize songs. I wanted an impactful visualization, something that packs a punch and will awe people, so I chose to use Ferrofluid, a magnetic liquid that reacts to magnetic fields.

An electromagnet is used to generate magnetic fields. This magnetic field controls the shape and movement of the ferrofluid, which in turn is controlled by the music.

Music is fed into the speaker through a Bluetooth music player.By syncing the ferrofluid with the beats of the music, the speaker will have a better visualization performance.
