### Professional camera for easy storage

{{< figure src="/images/projects/Limera/5.jpg" width="100%"  >}}

**LIMERA** is a **portable camera** that proposes a new **method of camera storage without compromising professionalty**, It implements a **swivel body** that allows the camera to be transformed into a smaller cylinder which is much **easier to store in bags and carry around**.

Professional cameras are big, bulky and have a weird shape, whereas LIMERA cuts the bulk of raditional cameres.The project originates from my hoby ofphotography, where l find traditional cameras hard to fit in my back pack.LIMERA is a combination of **conceptual product design**, **product modelling and ergonomic design**. For products like cameras, **user interaction** is a crucial part in my design, which is tested by making foam models to verfy the **feasibility of the concept**.
