### Tableware designed for office workers
**BENTO+** is a set of specilly designed bento boxes that have a **redesigned user experience**. It incorporates **special hinges** that allows the bento boxes to **swivel**, making it **easy to load** up with your favorite recipes and lit up to go without having to close each of the bento boxes.

The idea comes from my own experience of bringing breakfast in lunch boxes every day. Traditional lunch boxes are cumbersome to use. Bento+ has specially designed handle and joints that allow the boxes to be closed simply by lifting the handle up. The project incorporates my own ideal form of bento boxes that allows the user to cut,pack and go in flash. **This project emphasizes the design process of a product and the ablity to systematically designand analyze a product.**

### Ideation & Sketches

I explored with the shape of the lunch box and designed a lunch box holder with a sliding track. The lunch box can be easily mounted or taken out.

When the lunch box is taken out, I hope it can be combined with the chopping board to save space, and when installed, the three lunch boxes can become a whole, so that the office workers can carry it around easily.

### Storyboard

### Model Display
{{< figure src="/images/projects/bento/6.jpg" width="100%"  >}}

When placed horizontally, the cutting surface of the cutting board is inclined downward. When the lunch box is fixed on the cutting board, the cutting surface of the cutting board is raised by the height of the box, just so that the contents of the cutting board can be easily pushed into the boxes.

At the same time, there are raised edges around the cutting board, which can prevent the juices of cutting vegetables or fruits from getting onto the tabletop,and keep the tabletop tidy after cutting.
